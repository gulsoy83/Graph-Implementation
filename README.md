# Graph-Implementation

The program reads users' id from SNAgraph.csv, then creates a graph and inserts them.
After that, calculates the users who followed anyone most and the most followed users, etc.
Then, it calculates the shortest distances between all nodes by dijkstra algorithm.
You can see detailed info about this project in socialNetworkAnalysis.pdf.
NOTE: The fourth component in that pdf is not imlemented, yet.
